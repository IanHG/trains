Money:
   Each players starts with $2000-$3000. This money is used for buying trains
   and tracks from the bank, renting tracks from other players, 
   and as collateral for failed trips.

   Money is earned by completing trips, and selling owned equipment.
   Equipment can be sold to other players for whatever price can be negotiated,
   or to the bank for half the purchase price.

   Each player is allowed a credit of up to -$1000 when bidding for trips.
   No credit is allowed for buying, so if a player is in minus no purchases
   can be made.
